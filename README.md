# Class repositories
The idea for the class repositories is to give each class a place to hand in their work, mostly their homework but also anything else you need them to hand in. It gives a nice tracker of the progress of the students and allows mentors 1 place to work from without classes overlapping.

## Setting up a new class repository
- Create a new *private* repository named `class-CLASSNUMBER`
- The starting `README.md` for the class is given in [./templates/CLASS_README.md](./templates/CLASS_README.md)
- Add a `homework-handin-guide.md` in the class repository. Template is [here](./templates/homework-handin-guide.md)
- Create a new issue for the class mentor to add their information and assign them to it, they can then test out the issue template. The issue template can be found in [./templates/add-info-issue.md](./templates/add-info-issue.md)
- Add the following milestones:
  - JavaScript
  - Browsers
  - Using API's
  - NodeJS
  - Databases
  - React
  - Graduation Project
- Make sure the class repo only has the following labels:
  - Week1 (#c1e7ff)
  - Week2 (#abd2ec)
  - Week3 (#94bed9)
  - Week4 (#7faac6)
  - Week5 (#6996b3)
  - Project (#BE29A0)
  - Review in progress (#C2E0C6)
  - Reviewed with feedback (#F9D0C4)
  - Needs review (#FEF2C0)
- Add the following modules list code, replacing the class name with the correct one (TODO: update once class31 is a little further so we have latest version)
