# Class repositories
The idea for the class repositories is to give each class a place to hand in their work, mostly their homework but also anything else you need them to hand in. It gives a nice tracker of the progress of the students and allows mentors 1 place to work from without classes overlapping.

## Setting up a new class repository
- Create a new *private* repository named `class-CLASSNUMBER`
- The starting `README.md` for the class is given in [./templates/CLASS_README.md](./templates/CLASS_README.md)
- Create a new issue for the class mentor to add their information and assign them to it, they can then test out the issue template. The issue template can be found in [./templates/add-info-issue.md](./templates/add-info-issue.md)
- Add the following labels:
  - JavaScript
  - Browsers
  - Using API's
  - NodeJS
  - Databases
  - React
  - Week1
  - Week2
  - Week3
  - Week4
  - Week5
